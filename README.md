# Constructive Entropy-Driven Structure Theory

This repository presents a novel theoretical framework: **Constructive Entropy-Driven Structure Theory**. It explores the fundamental connection between entropy gradients and structural emergence through a constructivist lens. The theory suggests that information flux, rather than randomness, guides the direction of structural evolution in physical and informational systems.

## Key Concepts
- Entropic vector fields as drivers of structural complexity
- Constructive interpretation of entropy beyond thermodynamics
- Structure emergence via informational constraints
- Formalization applicable to AI, physics, and complex systems

## Files
- `README.md`: Overview of the theory
- `LICENSE`: Licensing information
- `sections/`: Contains modular breakdown of the theory

This theory is part of a broader initiative to apply constructive mathematics and AI-based reasoning to foundational issues in physics and system design.
