# Section 1: Definition

We define entropy-driven constructivism as a principle whereby structure is not a spontaneous consequence of disorder, but a result of a constrained process of information distribution.

# Section 2: Lemmas

- Lemma 1: Any increase in structural order implies a bounded entropy flux.
- Lemma 2: The entropy gradient vector correlates with constructive constraints.

# Section 3: Theorems

- Theorem 1: In a bounded system, constructive entropy leads to deterministic structure selection.
- Theorem 2: Entropy-driven fields determine the emergence direction of macroscopic order.
